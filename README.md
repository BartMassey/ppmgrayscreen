# ppmgrayscreen: Netpbm filter to establish page monochromaticity
Copyright (c) 2004 Bart Massey

ppmgrayscreen is a filter I wrote sometime in the early
2000s (if I recall correctly) to remove extraneous grading
marks from a student test I had accidentally marked up.  Its
basic mode of operation is to find pixels that are not a
shade of some target color (default black) and change them
to white.  It's not great, but better than nothing for this
job.

Please see the included manual page for invocation details.
